 * Implementation of the Label Propagation Algorithm:
 * The input graph as adjacency list contains the information about the
 * vertex (id), value (label) and its edges to neighbors.
 * <p/>
 * In super step 0 each vertex will propagate its value within his neighbors
 * <p/>
 * In the remaining super steps each vertex will adopt the value of the
 * majority of their neighbors or the smallest one if there are just one
 * neighbor. If a vertex adopt a new value it'll propagate the new one again.
 * <p/>
 * The computation will terminate if no new values are assigned.
